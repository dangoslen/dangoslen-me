## Is this over the top?
Probably. But oh well. 

If you want to set everything up, you just need to run ```npm install``` to get `less` and a few other things. 

This website is currently using 
* Font-Awesome (https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) for icons. Its pretty cool.
* Less (https://github.com/less/less.js) for CSS pre-processing. No, its not SASS and I'm not gonna engage in that fight.
* Skeleton (https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/) for basic setup and responsiveness starter.
* Angular
